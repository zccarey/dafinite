Running Dafny compiler:
    Run like "dafny /finitize:Server=1,Client=2 /vprint <vmtFile> /rprint <whatever>". Pass "-" as <vmtFile> to print to stdout.


========== DATATYPES ==========

- There must be a datatype "DafnyStat" that embodies the state.
- All other datatypes are the finitized types specified on the command line.
- All of the finitized types specificed on the command line must appear in the Dafny program.

========== PREDICATES ==========

FOR NOW:
    - Assume the only predicates are Init, Next, and state machine transitions. No other functions.
    - There must be a predicate "Next" that takes as input two "DafnyState"s.
      The first represents the new state, and the second represents the old/prev state.

IDEALLY LATER:
    - Allow other predicates and functions, but the relevant ones for us should
      be "Next", "Init", and state transition predicates named "DafnyStateTransition<Name>"
