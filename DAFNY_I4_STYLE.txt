Running Dafny compiler:
    Run like "dafny /finitize:Server=1,Client=2 /vprint <vmtFile> /rprint <whatever>". Pass "-" as <vmtFile> to print to stdout.


========== DATATYPES ==========

- There must be a datatype "DafnyStat" that embodies the state.
- All other datatypes are the finitized types specified on the command line.
- All of the finitized types specificed on the command line must appear in the Dafny program.
- If a datatype needs a unique ID, it should have a 

========== PREDICATES ==========

- There must be an Init and a Next
    - Init must take as parameter a single instance of DafnyState
    - Next must take two DafnyStates as parameters.
      The first represents the new state, and the second represents the old/prev state.
- All other predicates must be Actions or Relations, with respective name prefix
  "Action" and "Relation"
    - Relations must take as their first parameter a DafnyState (??? Don't think this is needed, not currently checking)
    - Actions must take exactly two parameters, both DafnyStates.
      The first represents the new state, and the second represents the old/prev state.
- No other predicates allowed (for now)
